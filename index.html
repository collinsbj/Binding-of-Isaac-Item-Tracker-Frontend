    <h1>The Ultimate
      <br> Binding of Isaac
      <br> Item Tracker</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the only Binding of Isaac item tracker you'll ever need, thoughtfully named: The Ultimate Binding of Isaac
      Item Tracker, aka UBIIT (yoo-bit)! New to town? Let's take a quick tour, shall we?</p>
    <h2>What is The Binding of Isaac?</h2>
    <p>I'm so glad you asked! According to Steam: The Binding of Isaac is a randomly generated action RPG shooter with heavy
      Rogue-like elements. Following Isaac on his journey players will find bizarre treasures that change Isaacâ€™s form giving
      him super human abilities and enabling him to fight off droves of mysterious creatures, discover secrets.</p>
    <p>TLDR: A super dope game that will take your soul (in a good way).</p>
    <h2>Tracker</h2>
    <p>The Tracker is where you can keep track of every item you've collected. Just picked up Brimstone? Sweet! Just tap on
      the Brimstone icon and it will gray out, indicating that you've collected it. Totes easy. After clicking on an item,
      try reloading the page. Your collection data stayed, yay!</p>
    <h2>Item List</h2>
    <p>The Item List, although looking visually identical to The Tracker, actually performs a very useful function. Let's say
      you've just come across an item you've never seen before and want to know exactly what it does before picking it up.
      Simply locate the item, tap it, and voila, all the information about Guppy's Head you could ever want.</p>
    <h2>Add New Item</h2>
    <p>Add New Item is where you, dear reader, can add items that might be missing from the Tracker or Item List. You might
      say to yourself "Bro, you like totally don't have Succubus on here at all!" If you feel so inclined, simply head over
      to Add New Item, enter in all the necessary information, and BOOM! Succubus will join it's friends on the Tracker and
      Item List. FYI: bindingofisaacrebirth.gamepedia.com is a great place to get png's to use for the image.</p>
    <h2>Future</h2>
    <p>What does the future hold for UBIIT? Geez, you're full of great questions today! Here's a list of features I plan on
      adding:</p>
    <ul class="futureList">
      <li>Combining the Item List and Tracker into one, do-it-all, spot</li>
      <li>Add all 534 items, 125 trinkets, consumables, characters, rooms, bosses, monsters, and item synergies</li>
      <li>Add the ability to search</li>
      <li>Add the ability to sort items by different parameters</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Ideas? Questions? Comments?</h2>
    <p>Please don't hesitate to shoot me an email if you have any feature requests, questions, or comments about UBIIT. Happy
      grinding!</p>
